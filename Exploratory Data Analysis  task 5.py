Observations:
1. Females had a much higher survival rate.
2. Wealthier passengers (higher Fare, 1st Class) survived more often.
3. Children had better chances of survival compared to adults.
4. Small families (1â€“2 members) survived more than large families or people traveling alone.
5. 'Cabin' has too many missing values and might need to be dropped or processed.
